## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is David MartÃ­nez
### I am an Electronic Engineer

Hi! My name is Juan David MartÃ­nez, I am 21 years old and I am originally from Bucaramanga, Colombia. After school I joined the Bolivarian Pontifical University to become an electronic engineer. Currently, I am in my last college year and Iâ€™ve learned a lot of things related with circuits, telecommunications, programming, biomedical engineering and of course machine learning. I have recently started a new path towards Data Science and Machine Learning because itâ€™s a topic I love and I really like solving problems. This is why I have switched into pursuing the Data Science and Machine Learning Industry, and I aspire to be on the forefront developing models and algorithms in all aspects of Artificial Intelligence. Although this is a long way from that goal, I strive to learn as much as I can making some small projects taking advantage of my free time.
